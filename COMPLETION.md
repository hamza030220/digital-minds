# Green Admin MVC - Project Completion

Congratulations! Your Green Admin MVC application has been successfully implemented with a proper Model-View-Controller architecture. This document summarizes what we've accomplished and how to access your application.

## What We've Built

1. **Complete MVC Architecture**
   - Models for stations, trajets, and users
   - Controllers to handle business logic
   - Views for user interaction
   - Base controller with common functionality

2. **Database Structure**
   - Properly structured tables with relationships
   - CRUD operations through models
   - Secure query handling with PDO

3. **Authentication System**
   - Secure login with password hashing
   - Session management
   - Password reset capability

4. **Improved Security**
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF token handling
   - Secure session configuration
   - Protected sensitive directories

5. **Development Tools**
   - Test script to verify functionality
   - Database setup automator
   - Deployment checklist
   - Comprehensive documentation

## How to Access Your Application

1. **Start XAMPP**
   - Ensure Apache and MySQL are running

2. **Run Auto-Setup**
   - Visit [http://localhost/green-admin-mvc/auto-setup.php](http://localhost/green-admin-mvc/auto-setup.php)
   - This will set up your database and admin user automatically

3. **Access the Application**
   - Go to [http://localhost/green-admin-mvc/](http://localhost/green-admin-mvc/)
   - Login with:
     * Username: **admin**
     * Password: **admin123**

4. **Change Default Password**
   - For security reasons, change the default admin password immediately

## Key Files to Know

- **Configuration**: `includes/config.php` - Database and application settings
- **Models**: `models/*.php` - Data access and business logic
- **Controllers**: `controllers/*.php` - Request handling
- **Views**: `views/*/*.php` - User interface templates

## Documentation

We've provided comprehensive documentation to help you understand and maintain your application:

- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `BROWSER_ACCESS.md` - How to access the application
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Database setup instructions
- `SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` - Final setup checklist
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Overview of the MVC implementation
