# Green Admin MVC - Project Summary

## Implementation Overview

This document summarizes the MVC restructuring of the Green Admin project. The project has been completely reorganized into a proper Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to improve maintainability, code organization, and security.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. MVC Architecture Implementation
- **Models**: Created data access layer with dedicated model classes
  - `StationModel.php` - CRUD operations for stations
  - `TrajetModel.php` - CRUD operations for trajets with route coordinates
  - `UserModel.php` - Authentication and user management
  
- **Views**: Separated presentation logic from business logic
  - Organized view templates into logical directories
  - Created error pages (404, 500)
  - Standardized headers across all pages
  
- **Controllers**: Implemented business logic layer
  - `StationController.php` - Station management operations
  - `TrajetController.php` - Trajet/route management operations
  - `AuthController.php` - Authentication operations
  - Base `Controller.php` - Common controller functionality

### 2. Routing System
- Implemented front controller pattern in `public/index.php`
- Created a clean URL structure
- Added proper routing to controllers and actions
- Set up error handling for invalid routes

### 3. Database Management
- Created SQL scripts for database setup
- Implemented models with proper SQL queries
- Used PDO with prepared statements for security
- Added foreign key constraints between tables

### 4. Security Enhancements
- Secure password hashing using PHP's native functions
- CSRF protection mechanisms
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS protection via output escaping
- Protected sensitive directories with .htaccess
- Session security improvements

### 5. Testing Capabilities
- Created test script (`test.php`)
- Added deployment checklist (`deploy-checklist.php`)
- Database verification tool (`db-test.php`)
- Sample data generation

```

## Key Files

- **Configuration**: `includes/config.php`
- **Front Controller**: `public/index.php`
- **Base Controller**: `includes/Controller.php`
- **Database Connection**: Handled in `getDBConnection()` function
- **Authentication**: Managed by `UserModel.php` and `AuthController.php`

## Usage

1. **Access the application**:
   - URL: http://localhost/green-admin-mvc/ or http://greenadmin.local/
   - Default login: admin / admin123

2. **Manage stations**:
   - Create, edit, and delete stations
   - Toggle station active status

3. **Manage trajets (routes)**:
   - Create routes between stations
   - Add route coordinates and descriptions
   - Calculate distances

## Next Steps

Potential improvements for the future:

1. **Add authentication middleware**
2. **Implement more advanced routing**
3. **Add unit and integration tests**
4. **Create admin user management interface**
5. **Implement caching system**
6. **Add API endpoints for mobile applications**
